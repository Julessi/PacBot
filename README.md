# PackBot
AI major - school final project 
 
 My classmate and I built this magnificent project in 11th-12th grade while learning how to code using languages such as: python and C.
 We used a laptop for arduino and a Raspberry Pi 4 for python (We had to install by ourselves the OS using Raspberry Pi Imager in a microSD card 32GB, also Raspberry Pi 4 uses Linux OS so it was a hugely interesting experience for us)

The main idea of the robot was for it to work as a car and organize things in a warehouse.
 While working on it, we combined multiple sensors and components in order to make it more challanging.
 Furthermore, we acquired various communication protocols during this project. Moreover, we used wisely our Physics knowledge since part of the components needed 12th grade physics understanding, in order to understand clearly how the components worked. 
 Also, we had to use some physics formulas in order to calculate some things. 
 Finally, our teacher gave us an idea to include a telegram bot, to make it even more interesting.
